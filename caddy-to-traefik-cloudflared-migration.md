# Migration from Caddy to Traefik with Cloudflared SSL

This document summarizes the changes made to replace Caddy with Traefik as the reverse proxy and to use Cloudflared for SSL/TLS termination.

## Changes Made

### 1. Traefik Configuration

- Created `traefik.yml` for static Traefik configuration
- Created `dynamic_conf.yml` for dynamic Traefik configuration
- Configured Traefik to route traffic to all services
- Set up Traefik to work with Cloudflared

### 2. Cloudflared Integration

- Created `cloudflared/config.yml` for Cloudflare Tunnel configuration
- Created `docker-compose-cloudflared.yml` for running Cloudflared
- Created `setup-cloudflare-tunnel.sh` script to help users set up a Cloudflare Tunnel
- Created `CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md` documentation for using Cloudflare Tunnel

### 3. Docker Compose Files

- Created `docker-compose-traefik.yml` for running Traefik without Cloudflared
- Created `docker-compose-combined.yml` for running both Traefik and Cloudflared

## Benefits of the New Setup

### Traefik vs Caddy

| Feature | Traefik | Caddy |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Configuration | YAML-based | Caddyfile |
| Docker Integration | Native | Plugin |
| Dashboard | Yes | No |
| Middleware | Extensive | Limited |
| Community | Large | Medium |
| Performance | High | High |

### Cloudflared vs Let's Encrypt

| Feature | Cloudflared | Let's Encrypt |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| SSL Certificates | Managed by Cloudflare | Self-managed |
| Port Forwarding | Not required | Required |
| DDoS Protection | Yes | No |
| Setup Complexity | Simple | Moderate |
| Cost | Free | Free |
| Renewal | Automatic | Automatic |

## How to Use

### Local Development (No SSL)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-traefik.yml up -d
```

### Production with Cloudflared (SSL)

1. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup-cloudflare-tunnel.sh
   ```

2. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-combined.yml up -d
   ```

## Troubleshooting

See the `CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md` file for detailed troubleshooting steps.

## Future Improvements

1. Add authentication middleware for securing services
2. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
3. Set up monitoring and alerting for the services
4. Create a web UI for managing the Cloudflare Tunnel configuration
